This is a simple implementation of the Firebug's Console API (http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API)

= How to use =
 1. import Console;
 2. Console.log("hi!");
 3. There is no third step

= Methods available =
For now there is only the basic of the Console API :

 * Console.log
 * Console.info
 * Console.warn
 * Console.error
 * Console.clear

You can call these methods just like in Firebug or the WebInspector : Console.log(foo) or Console.log(foo, bar) or whateverâ€¦

= Limitations =
Sometimes you want to log things that doesn't make sense for the DOM. The common example is logging an event.
You'll have a target: [stage Stage] which doesn't make sense. Note that this class will display a string for non-native types or for things that doesn't make sense.
It will *not* convert these instances to bulk objects. If you want this feature fork it ;).
